# SupervisedML
This project is a kaggle competition to estimate housing prices with 80 different features. My code is a fully supervised ML pipeline, including splitting of training and test data, preprocessing steps like imputing, OneHot-Encoding or Ordinal-Encodnig for categorical data and different algorithms. The algorithm also includes Cross Validation to address the problem of overfitting. Some, but not extensive, hyperparameter tuning is made for:
- Decision Tree
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Random Forest
